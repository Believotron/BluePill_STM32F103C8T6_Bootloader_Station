This is a WIP project to create a turnkey bootloader programming station for the "BluePill" STM32F103C8T6 development boards.

These boards are a great, low cost way to get started with Arduino or microcontrollers, but bootloading is still a dividing skill to access that low cost.

This project will contain hardware, 3D enclosure files, BOM, and instructions on how to program the bootloader.
